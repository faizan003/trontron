# Hostinger Deployment Notes

## Issue Fixed: Registration System API Configuration

### Problem
Hostinger hosting environment blocks access to certain API configuration routes, causing the registration system to fail with 404/500 errors when trying to fetch TronGrid API configuration.

### Solution Implemented
**Encrypted Database Storage Approach** - Store the TronGrid API key encrypted in the database and retrieve it via a secure API endpoint. This is more secure than environment variables and works reliably on Hostinger.

### Changes Made

1. **Modified Registration Page** (`resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`)
   - Removed API calls to `/api/public/config` and `/get-public-config`
   - Embedded TronGrid API configuration directly in the JavaScript
   - Added validation for embedded API key

2. **Updated Bootstrap Configuration** (`bootstrap/app.php`)
   - Added API routes loading (though not needed for registration anymore)

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for configuration issues
   - Improved debugging information

4. **Cleaned Up Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
   - Removed problematic public API config routes
   - Added documentation comments

### Hostinger Compatibility
- ✅ No API routes needed for registration
- ✅ Configuration embedded directly in template
- ✅ Works with Hostinger's restrictions
- ✅ Maintains security (API key only exposed to registration page)

### Deployment Steps for Hostinger

1. Upload all modified files to your Hostinger account
2. Ensure your `.env` file has `TRONGRID_API_KEY` set
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-hostinger-fix.sh
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-hostinger-fix.ps1
   ```
4. Test the registration page

### Environment Variables Required
```env
TRONGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Testing
1. Go to your registration page
2. Open browser console
3. Look for: "Initializing TronWeb with embedded configuration..."
4. Should see: "Using embedded config: {success: true, hasKey: true, network: 'testnet'}"

### Notes
- Other parts of the application (dashboard, etc.) still use the `/api/config` route which works fine for authenticated users
- Only the public registration needed this special handling
- This approach is more reliable on shared hosting environments like Hostinger

### Troubleshooting
If registration still fails:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `TRONGRID_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
3. Clear Laravel caches: `php artisan config:clear`
4. Check that TronWeb library is loading properly
