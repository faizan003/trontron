# Hostinger Deployment Notes

## Issue Fixed: Registration System API Configuration

### Problem
Hostinger hosting environment blocks access to certain API configuration routes, causing the registration system to fail with 404/500 errors when trying to fetch TronGrid API configuration.

### Solution Implemented
**Encrypted Database Storage Approach** - Store the TronGrid API key encrypted in the database and retrieve it via a secure API endpoint. This is more secure than environment variables and works reliably on Hostinger.

### Changes Made

1. **Created Encrypted API Configuration System**
   - `ApiConfig` model with encryption/decryption methods
   - Database migration for `api_configs` table
   - Artisan command `php artisan api:setup` for configuration

2. **Updated Controllers** (`app/Http/Controllers/SecureApiController.php`)
   - Modified to use encrypted database storage instead of environment variables
   - Better error handling and debugging information

3. **Modified Registration Page** (`resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`)
   - Updated to fetch configuration from `/api/public/config` endpoint
   - Enhanced error handling for configuration issues

4. **Updated Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
   - Added multiple Hostinger-compatible endpoints:
     - `/tron-config` (primary endpoint)
     - `/get-tron-config` (ultra-simple fallback)
     - `/config-test` (testing endpoint)

### Hostinger Compatibility
- ✅ API configuration stored encrypted in database
- ✅ No dependency on environment variables in production
- ✅ Works with Hostinger's restrictions
- ✅ Enhanced security with Laravel encryption
- ✅ Centralized configuration management

### Deployment Steps for Hostinger

1. Upload all modified files to your Hostinger account
2. Ensure your `.env` file has `TRONGRID_API_KEY` set
3. Run the deployment script (this will automatically set up the encrypted database configuration):
   ```bash
   ./deploy-hostinger-fix.sh
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-hostinger-fix.ps1
   ```
4. Alternatively, set up manually:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --force
   php artisan api:setup
   ```
5. Test the registration page

### Environment Variables Required
```env
TRONGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Testing
1. Go to your registration page
2. Open browser console
3. Look for: "Fetching API configuration from encrypted database..."
4. Should see: "API config retrieved: {success: true, hasKey: true, network: 'testnet'}"
5. Test the API endpoints directly: 
   - `/tron-config` (primary)
   - `/get-tron-config` (fallback)
   - `/config-test` (testing)

### Notes
- Other parts of the application (dashboard, etc.) still use the `/api/config` route which works fine for authenticated users
- Only the public registration needed this special handling
- This approach is more reliable on shared hosting environments like Hostinger

### Troubleshooting
If registration still fails:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `TRONGRID_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
3. Clear Laravel caches: `php artisan config:clear`
4. Check that TronWeb library is loading properly
